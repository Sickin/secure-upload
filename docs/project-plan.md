# Secure Document Upload Portal - Project Plan

## Executive Summary
Build a secure, role-based document collection portal that integrates with Salesforce to streamline client onboarding and compliance document gathering. Think "Dropbox meets compliance auditor's dream."

## Technical Architecture

### Recommended Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript  
- **Database**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (with encryption)
- **Authentication**: Azure AD B2C
- **Infrastructure**: Azure App Service + Azure Functions
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights

### Why This Stack?
Your choice of React/Node/PostgreSQL is solid. Adding Azure-native services gives you enterprise security, compliance features, and seamless scaling without the headaches.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Security Foundation (2-3 weeks)
**Core Components:**
- Azure resource provisioning and networking
- Database schema design and migration system
- Authentication/authorization framework
- File upload security and encryption
- Basic API structure with rate limiting

**Key Security Features:**
- Files encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) foundation
- Audit logging for all file operations

### Phase 2: Form Template Builder (2-3 weeks)
**Components:**
- Form template creation interface
- Document type management (Driver's License, SSN, Medical Records, etc.)
- Form grouping and naming system
- Template versioning and history
- Drag-and-drop form builder (think Typeform but for compliance)

**Database Tables:**
```sql
form_templates, form_fields, document_types, 
form_groups, template_versions
```

### Phase 3: Client Upload Portal (3-4 weeks)
**Components:**
- Dynamic form rendering based on templates
- Secure file upload with progress tracking
- Multi-file upload with metadata capture
- Mobile-responsive design (matching your sleek UI aesthetic)
- Link expiration handling (60-day TTL)
- Progress saving/resumption capability

**Key Features:**
- Chunked uploads for large files
- File type validation and virus scanning
- Upload completion confirmation page
- Expired link landing page with re-request option

### Phase 4: Role-Based Dashboard System (3-4 weeks)
**User Roles & Permissions:**
- **Compliance**: Full access (view, download, audit)
- **Sales Managers**: View-only access to documents
- **Recruiters**: Status visibility only (uploaded/pending)
- **Admins**: User management and system configuration

**Dashboard Views:**
- Recruiter: Personal link status board
- Manager: Team overview with employee grouping
- Compliance: Full document access with search/filter
- Admin: System analytics and user management

### Phase 5: API Development & Salesforce Integration (2-3 weeks)
**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/links/generate (Salesforce → Portal)
GET /api/documents/{jobNumber} (Portal → Salesforce)
GET /api/links/{linkId}/status
PUT /api/links/{linkId}/extend
```

**Integration Features:**
- Salesforce custom objects for tracking
- Webhook notifications back to Salesforce
- Job number validation and tracking
- Bulk link generation capabilities

### Phase 6: Notifications & Communication (1-2 weeks)
**Email System:**
- Batched upload notifications to recruiters
- Completion confirmations to clients
- Expiration warnings (7 days before)
- New link generation notifications

**Notification Engine:**
- Azure Communication Services for email
- Template-based messaging system
- Delivery tracking and retry logic

### Phase 7: Analytics & Polish (2-3 weeks)
**Reporting Features:**
- Upload completion rates by form type
- Time-to-completion analytics
- User activity dashboards
- Compliance reporting exports

**Performance Optimizations:**
- CDN setup for global file delivery
- Database query optimization
- Frontend performance tuning
- Load testing and scaling prep

## Database Schema Highlights

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Link Management
upload_links (id, job_number, form_template_id, expires_at, created_by)
upload_sessions (link_id, client_info, status, completed_at)

-- Document Management  
documents (id, session_id, file_path, metadata, uploaded_at)
document_access_log (user_id, document_id, action, timestamp)

-- Form System
form_templates (id, name, description, created_by)
form_fields (template_id, field_type, required, display_order)

-- User Management
users (id, email, role, manager_id, azure_ad_id)
permissions (role, resource, actions)
```

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- All PII encrypted with rotating keys
- Document retention policies configurable
- GDPR-style data deletion capabilities
- Comprehensive audit trails

### Access Controls
- Multi-factor authentication required
- IP restrictions for admin functions
- Session timeout and concurrent login limits
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **File corruption**: Implement checksums and backup storage
- **Performance**: Use Azure CDN and implement caching strategies
- **Security breaches**: Regular penetration testing and monitoring

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Intuitive UI design and comprehensive training
- **Integration failures**: Thorough Salesforce testing and fallback procedures
- **Compliance issues**: Regular security audits and policy reviews

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Duration**: 16-22 weeks (4-5.5 months)

**Parallel Development Opportunities:**
- Frontend and backend can develop simultaneously after Phase 1
- Form builder and upload portal can overlap
- API development can start during dashboard phase

## Additional Considerations

### Future Enhancements
- OCR for automatic data extraction
- Digital signature capabilities  
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app for on-the-go uploads
- Integration with other CRM systems

### Scalability Plan
- Azure auto-scaling groups
- Database read replicas for reporting
- CDN for global file distribution
- Microservices architecture for future modules

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ upload completion rate
- Sub-3-second page load times
- Zero security incidents
- 50%+ reduction in manual document processing time

**Next Steps**: Set up Azure environment and start with Phase 1 infrastructure. The foundation phase is critical - get security right from day one, and everything else becomes easier.
